# Machine-Learning-Identify-Fraud-from-Enron-Email
Final Udacity Project


Project Overview
In this project, you will play detective, and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

Why this Project?
This project will teach you the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens.

It will teach you how to extract and identify useful features that best represent your data, a few of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms today, and how to evaluate the performance of your machine learning algorithms.

What will I learn?
By the end of the project, you will be able to:

Deal with an imperfect, real-world dataset
Validate a machine learning result using test data
Evaluate a machine learning result using quantitative metrics
Create, select and transform features
Compare the performance of machine learning algorithms
Tune machine learning algorithms for maximum performance
Communicate your machine learning algorithm results clearly
Why is this Important to my Career?
Machine learning is a first-class ticket to the most exciting careers in data analysis today. As data sources proliferate along with the computing power to process them, going straight to the data is one of the most straightforward ways to quickly gain insights and make predictions.

In this project, you're working with a real dataset that, by itself, had existed almost stagnantly for years. However, through using machine learning and data science, the insights drawn from this data had a huge impact on a corporation and the economy.
